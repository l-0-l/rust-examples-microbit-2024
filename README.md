# A few small examples for a 2024 Rust for embedded meetup to starting off with a micro:bit
Here are 5 separate rust projects, going from a hello world to a micro:bit accelerometer operated mouse. The device in use is micro:bit v1.5.
- ex1: hello-world over RTT
- ex2: 5x5 led display demo
- ex3: Serial interface and buttons demo (see comments in main.rs to see the PC-side setup)
- ex4: Serial interface and accelerometer data demo (see comments in main.rs to see the PC-side setup)
- ex5: make micro:bit operate the PC's mouse coursor or my old SpaceGame Space Invaders clone in Python (see comments in main.rs to see the PC-side setup)
